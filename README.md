<h3>DRIVER SAFETY DETECTION USING OPENCV:</h3>

•	Developed a safety technology with a computer vision system that can detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and plays an alarm if the driver appears drowsy to prevent accidents.<br>
•	Worked on Python libraries NumPy, OpenCV, and Dlib’s pre-trained facial landmark detectors to implement face recognition for drivers.<br>
•	User gets a wakeup alarm when he/she gets drowsy and his emergency contacts get an immediate alert message to let them know about his situation.<br>

<h3>TRADING WEBSITE:<br></h3>
•	As a part of my Master's program, I registered in ITIS 5166: Network-Based Application Development. As a final project, I designed and developed a complete web application from scratch.<br>
•	Created the front end of the website using just HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and for the backend node.js, Angular JS, and Mongo DB that included functionalities such as sessions, cookies, user authentication, and so on.<br>
•	Also used AngularJS to build dynamic, single-page web applications.<br>
•	IDE: Visual Studio Code
•	Testing: Google Chrome, Postman<br>
<h3>COVID-19 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION:</h3>
•	Using the COVID-19 dataset, classified images as to if images were COVID infected or not.<br>
•	The images were converted to grayscale images for analysis.<br>
•	Using Convolution Neural Networks, built a model with a 2D convolution layer, Maxpooling layer, and output softmax layer to generate classes for each corresponding image<br>
•	Trained the model with 10 epochs and enabled callbacks to stop when the desired accuracy is reached<br>
•	Compared results to the existing Mobilnet model and achieved better results.<br>
